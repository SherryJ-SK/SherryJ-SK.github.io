            <br />
            I enjoy establishing functional websites, which not only have great 
            UX but also have greate UI. With each project, my goal is to design an 
            user interface that improves user experience through the use of organised 
            structure and concise design.
            <br />
            <br />
            Recently earned a Certificate in Full Stack Development from University of 
            Sydney Bootcamp, wtih strong fundamentals of multiple languages, HTML, CSS 
            and JavaScript. Currently working on an individual project to build a MERN 
            stack application, which allows the users to know and enjoy the game, 
            Animal Crossing and enabling them to share userful information and 
            communicate with friends.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am able to apply my past experience in the workplace and the required 
            knowledge acquired from the Bootcamp to work on both front and bank end development.
